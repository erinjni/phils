Up until 1994, the a cappella scene at Rice was sparse. Groups like the Night Owls, Brown Quartet, and All-Lovett Accord were formed, but none managed to last. Laura Huff and Emily Jiang decided to change this. Together, they created the group that would one day be known as the Rice Philharmonics.

Since these humble beginnings, the Philharmonics have expanded their influence across campus, in the Houston community, and throughout the nation. The Phils have performed at several competitions, including the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. Most recently, they were semi-finalists in the 2022 ICCAs. The Phils have also recorded and released multiple studio albums. Their newest album is currently in the works and will be available to stream on iTunes and Spotify soon. Be on the lookout!

### Upcoming Performances

The Phils pherform at several venues across Rice’s campus and throughout the Houston area. Our annual concerts include…
- fall concert: Phils are traditionally joined onstage by alumni during Africa
- holiday concert: Wearing an ugly holiday sweater is encouraged but not required
- acapellooza: All of Rice’s a cappella groups have individual showcases, followed by a group song
- all request: Audience members decide the Phils’ set list, which includes senior solos (bring those tissues)
