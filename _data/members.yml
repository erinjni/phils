      blurb: "biggest bigback, belly slapper, goon but also big brain I know both musically and academically. Ngl when I found out Josh was premed I was a little surprised. Like I can see his nerdy side but lowky he‚Äôs too much of a goon sometimes for me to take him seriously. Favorite hobbies include yapping, beatboxing, producing Phil‚Äôs music on fondy first floor, laughing at his own jokes, eating and more eating."

This senior(so sad don‚Äôt leave us) at Jones hailing all the way phrom Miami, Phlorida is quite the studious phil majoring in Neuroscience, Biochemistry, and Medical Humanities! She‚Äôs also quite the diverse musician and sings everything from mezzo, soprano, and alto! As an avid Beli user, you‚Äôll find her in your local coffee shops locking in(yapping). The iron phist(warmth and kindness) she rules(graces us with) is something the Phils will never be complete without!"

      blurb: "Get hype! Erin is a Senior and ECE major Engineering Design minor! Wow! She‚Äôs from Sunnyvale and Jones College, and, watch out!- she‚Äôs a black belt in karate. She likes hiking and going to the gym, tea, and hot pot is her favorite food. Yum! She is also a master clarinet player, so if you ever see her, be sure to ask her to play something (or else she‚Äôll be really sad). Additionally, she is beautiful, stunning, and drop-dead gorgeous- and she sings with the voice of an angel."

      blurb: "Have you watched a recent phils performance on youtube?? Did you notice the pristine quality and craftsmanship of the camera work??? Well, you owe a big thank you to the Phils‚Äô very own recording manager: Kairi Mano!! ü§© With a camera practically glued to his side, this guy never fails to show off his creativeness‚Äî ooh you wanna click on this link so bad to see his portfolio https://kairimano.com ‚Äîbut he also knows when to lock in for his sports management major and stat and data science minors. Gracing us with his beautiful bari/tenor voice all the way from Tokyo, Japan, Kairi is also a junior at Lovett, and he‚Äôll never let you forget that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbest college‚Äù‚Ä¶his words, not mine. Whether he‚Äôs fueling his caffeine addiction at Chaus, going on a run around campus, or doing a backflip at acappellooza, everyone can find a reason to love Kairi! We‚Äôre so glad to have his talents and cinematography skills in the Phils, so we hope you keep enjoying the silly little vlogs he creates as well as sitting back and listening to him sing!!"

      silly: jordan silly.jpg
      blurb: "I heard there was a secret chord that Jordan sang and he left us floored‚Äîbut does he actually know any music? Apparently not. Meet Jordan, our amazing bass from Lake Charles, Louisiana, now in his third year with the Phils! This electrical engineering major has a voice with crazy range and can nail any song you throw at him, which is ironic because he barely recognizes any of them. Jordan is the foundation of our group in more ways than one‚Äîhis deep voice grounds us and holds us together, and he's ALWAYS there on time (if any of us are late to rehearsal we face his wrath). Beyond his soothing voice and calming presence, Jordan also arranges music for us and we can't wait for you all to hear what he brings to the Phils this year!"

      blurb: "Sixth member's bio."
      id: "Time to cElla-brate because we‚Äôre introducing our beautiful Ella!!! Ellavation and Ellation come when we‚Äôre all with Ella! As treasurer for the Phils, Ella treasures us almost as much as we treasure her presence and her smooth, silky, and incredibly impressive soprano range. Don‚Äôt be fooled by her rbf because Ella‚Äôs the sweetest cinnamon roll at heart. One thing you should know about this Lovetteer is that while she is a BioSciences (and English!) major, she is NOT pre-med (and will make sure you know that). She‚Äôs actually the most passionate person you‚Äôll meet about astrobiology (wow! cool!). Aside from rocking it with the Phils, Ella is also a prominent figure in the theater scene at Rice (ooh! ahh!) and consistently graces the stages of every college (theater kid!) with an awesome performance every time. Ella‚Äôs an integral part of the Phils, and we can‚Äôt wait to have her around again!"
    - name: "Jace Liu '28"

      silly: jace silly.jpg
      blurb: "What‚Äôs that sound?!?! Could it be Mickey Mouse? Elmo??? This serenading tenor/alto voice could only belong to‚Ä¶ you guessed it - JACE LIU!!!!! This incredible Phil is mutlitalented. From MOB, to Duncan theater (ask him about his unfortunate affection), to astounding arrangements, the only thing he can‚Äôt conquer is spicy food. As the Phil‚Äôs‚Äô resident chef, he graces those around him  with culinary masterpieces. What would we do without his delectable sweet treats?!!?!? (I‚Äôm glad we never have to phind out). Jace is a Duncan sophomore majoring in psychology. Representing the pre-meds, this new x8 skibidi Ohio (Cleveland, specifically) Phil is a central part of our phamily."

      silly: losh silly.jpg
      blurb: "Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend‚Ä¶ Josh Yang! The smaller of our two Joshes, this short king loves serenading us with his angelic whistling and his beautiful, buttery-smooth baritone/tenor/bass voice (like, how is one person this talented?). When he‚Äôs not serenading you, this junior Martelian majors in Asian Studies and Linguistics, is a baking fiend‚Äîespecially when it comes to his scrumdiddlyumptious matcha madeleines‚Äîand is always dressed to impress. Beyond his brilliant baking, academic, and musical prowess, Josh is always an upbeat, positive presence in rehearsals, and you just have to come see him in concert! And maybe, if you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll be graced by his enchanting whistling."

      silly: zach silly.jpg
      blurb: "When your mom says \"we don't need Jungkook, we have Jungkook at home,\" Zach is exactly who she's talking about! This new x8 Phil is the current Business Manager for the Phils and no one is doing it like he is. Between booking us for philanthropic gigs, crashing out over the next orgo and physics exams, sliding into your DMs with his exquisite mouth trumpeting, and being On The Pre-Med Track, we really have no idea how he has the time to be Standing Next to You. Whether you need him to drive you to Whataburger at 10pm for an impromptu late-night snack or you need a buddy for a concert that you impulsively bought two tickets for because they cost you $12.63 in total with tax and fees, Zach is (usually) down and enthusiastic for a chance to hang out and make some everlasting memories. Every day, the Phils bow down to Zach in complete reverence for his Complete and Total Utter Awesomeness and Cool Ohio Skibidi Rizz, and we thank him for his Twinkatron services at least bimonthly. As we like to say in the Phils, you know that all night long Zach Mok to this!"

      silly: mason silly.jpg
      blurb: "If you spot a Phil at Chaus, there‚Äôs a very good chance that it‚Äôs Mason Kwon, who managed to rapidly deplete his Tetra halfway through his first semester at Rice. You can‚Äôt really blame him, though- as a freshman Archi major, overcaffination is definitely a must. Mason hails from the great state of Louisiana, but now calls Sid Rich his home. Although he‚Äôs now a Phil through and through, Mason actually has a penchant for classical music, both with casual listening and playing violin in the Campanile orchestra (we love a multitalented musician)!! We‚Äôre so glad to have his talent in the Phil‚Äôs, and can‚Äôt wait to make music with him this year!!!!!"

SHE US FROM BETHESDA, MARYLAND. Anyway‚Ä¶ this premed(?) girlie is majoring in neuroscience (a piece of cake for this ‚Äúbrainy‚Äù queen üß†). When she‚Äôs not riding horses or studying for the next orgo exam, you can find her jamming out to theater tunes! If you love Tex-Mex, you know where to find someone to go on a taco adventure. If you ever find someone riding a horse with a warm smile and a taco in one hand, you‚Äôve found Hannah!!!!"

      blurb: "Worried about your plans for this summer? If you‚Äôre looking for someone to secure you an internship, worry no longer! Elie‚Äôs got you covered. A sophomore Bakerite from Dallas, Texas, you can find Elie applying for her next big opportunity or working on projects as a Team Lead for 180 Degrees Consulting. You‚Äôll never be afraid to crack jokes when Elie‚Äôs around, since she‚Äôs always full of laughter! Make sure to hit this business-psychology double major up if you‚Äôre ever looking for company during a good meal or wanting to jam out to Olivia Dean. This alto never fails to bring a smile to our faces, and we‚Äôre super glad to have her in the Phils!"

She's DOUBLE majoring in psychology and sociology üß†ü§Ø, so please feel free to ask her all your existential questions.

      blurb: "Meet Lauren, a freshman from the bustling metropolis of McKinney, TX, where dreams are big and naps are even bigger. Currently majoring in something (we‚Äôll update you when she figures that out), she‚Äôs at least minoring in theatre, which explains her dramatic entrances into the middle of rehearsal. When Lauren‚Äôs not performing, she‚Äôs probably either buried in a book or asking all of the grown-ups around her, ‚ÄúDo you have any games on your phone?‚Äù"
