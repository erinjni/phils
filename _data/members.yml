      blurb: "biggest bigback, belly slapper, goon but also big brain I know both musically and academically. Ngl when I found out Josh was premed I was a little surprised. Like I can see his nerdy side but lowky he‚Äôs too much of a goon sometimes for me to take him seriously. Favorite hobbies include yapping, beatboxing, producing Phil‚Äôs music on fondy first floor, laughing at his own jokes, eating and more eating."

      blurb: "Everyone meet our wonderphul and Phil‚Äôs phavorite phresident Dhilani Premaratne! This senior(so sad don‚Äôt leave us) at Jones hailing all the way phrom Miami, Phlorida is quite the studious phil majoring in Neuroscience, Biochemistry, and Medical Humanities! She‚Äôs also quite the diverse musician and sings everything from mezzo, soprano, and alto! As an avid Beli user, you‚Äôll find her in your local coffee shops locking in(yapping). The iron phist(warmth and kindness) she rules(graces us with) is something the Phils will never be complete without!"

      blurb: "Get hype! Erin is a Senior and ECE major Engineering Design minor! Wow! She‚Äôs from Sunnyvale and Jones College, and, watch out!- she‚Äôs a black belt in karate. She likes hiking and going to the gym, tea, and hot pot is her favorite food. Yum! She is also a master clarinet player, so if you ever see her, be sure to ask her to play something (or else she‚Äôll be really sad). Additionally, she is beautiful, stunning, and drop-dead gorgeous- and she sings with the voice of an angel."

      blurb: "Have you watched a recent phils performance on youtube?? Did you notice the pristine quality and craftsmanship of the camera work??? Well, you owe a big thank you to the Phils‚Äô very own recording manager: Kairi Mano!! ü§© With a camera practically glued to his side, this guy never fails to show off his creativeness‚Äî ooh you wanna click on this link so bad to see his portfolio https://kairimano.com ‚Äîbut he also knows when to lock in for his sports management major and stat and data science minors. Gracing us with his beautiful bari/tenor voice all the way from Tokyo, Japan, Kairi is also a junior at Lovett, and he‚Äôll never let you forget that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbest college‚Äù‚Ä¶his words, not mine. Whether he‚Äôs fueling his caffeine addiction at Chaus, going on a run around campus, or doing a backflip at acappellooza, everyone can find a reason to love Kairi! We‚Äôre so glad to have his talents and cinematography skills in the Phils, so we hope you keep enjoying the silly little vlogs he creates as well as sitting back and listening to him sing!!"

      silly: jordan silly.jpg
      blurb: "I heard there was a secret chord that Jordan sang and he left us floored‚Äîbut does he actually know any music? Apparently not. Meet Jordan, our amazing bass from Lake Charles, Louisiana, now in his third year with the Phils! This electrical engineering major has a voice with crazy range and can nail any song you throw at him, which is ironic because he barely recognizes any of them. Jordan is the foundation of our group in more ways than one‚Äîhis deep voice grounds us and holds us together, and he's ALWAYS there on time (if any of us are late to rehearsal we face his wrath). Beyond his soothing voice and calming presence, Jordan also arranges music for us and we can't wait for you all to hear what he brings to the Phils this year!"
