      blurb: "biggest bigback, belly slapper, goon but also big brain I know both musically and academically. Ngl when I found out Josh was premed I was a little surprised. Like I can see his nerdy side but lowky he’s too much of a goon sometimes for me to take him seriously. Favorite hobbies include yapping, beatboxing, producing Phil’s music on fondy first floor, laughing at his own jokes, eating and more eating."

      blurb: "Get hype! Erin is a Senior and ECE major Engineering Design minor! Wow! She’s from Sunnyvale and Jones College, and, watch out!- she’s a black belt in karate. She likes hiking and going to the gym, tea, and hot pot is her favorite food. Yum! She is also a master clarinet player, so if you ever see her, be sure to ask her to play something (or else she’ll be really sad). Additionally, she is beautiful, stunning, and drop-dead gorgeous- and she sings with the voice of an angel."
